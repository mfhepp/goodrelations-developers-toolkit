This set of HTML templates, instructions, and samples makes it super-simple to develop a PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Perl module that adds rich GoodRelations data-markup in RDFa syntax to the shop pages so that search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing can display richer item previews in the search results ("Rich Snippets") with information about prices, availability, delivery options, images, etc. This typically increases Click-Through-Rates (CTR) by up to 30%.

At the same time, your shop will be more accessible for browser extensions and mobile applications.
